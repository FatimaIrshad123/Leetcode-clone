Excited to share my latest project! I built a LeetCode clone using Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase. 
Key Technologies Used:
Next.js: For server-side rendering and optimized performance.
TypeScript: Enhancing code quality and maintainability.
Firebase: Providing authentication, real-time database, and hosting services.
Tailwind CSS: Creating a responsive and beautiful UI with utility-first styling.
Recoil: Managing global state effectively throughout the application.
React Icons: Enriching the interface with customizable icons.
React Toastify: Displaying user notifications with ease.
React Codemirror: Integrating a powerful code editor for users to write and test their solutions.
React Split: Enabling a flexible and resizable layout for the coding environment.
React Firebase Hooks: Simplifying interactions with Firebase for better code efficiency.
This project also incorporates various other libraries to enhance functionality.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
